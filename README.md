# Treatment-Recommendation--App
This project is a Shiny web application for medical treatment recommendations. Users can input a diagnosis, age, gender, and medical history, and upon clicking the "Recommend Treatment" button, the app provides a treatment recommendation based on the diagnosis. The recommendations are generated from a predefined list of treatment options for specific diagnoses, with the option to include the user's medical history in the recommendation. This app serves as a simple medical advice tool, demonstrating how Shiny can be used to create interactive interfaces for healthcare-related tasks.
